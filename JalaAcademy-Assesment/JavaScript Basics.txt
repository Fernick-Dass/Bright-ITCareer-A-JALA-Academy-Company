7. JavaScript differs from Java in several ways:
 - JavaScript is a scripting language primarily used for web development, while Java is a general-purpose programming language.
 - JavaScript is interpreted and runs in the browser, while Java is compiled and runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
 - JavaScript has dynamic typing, whereas Java has static typing.
 - JavaScript is prototype-based, while Java is class-based.
 - JavaScript has automatic memory management (garbage collection), while in Java, memory management is handled manually.
 - JavaScript is often used for client-side scripting, whereas Java is used for both client-side and server-side applications.
